Learning to code and developing software can be a daunting task. 
Indeed whether it is through the difficulty of properly tracking every component of the project, choosing the right modules and functions to use, or anticipating bugs there is a great barrier to entry in the field of programming.
Additionally even experienced developers face such difficulties and spend a lot of resources on fixing issues and searching information on external sources integrated into their code.
The main source of these problems is the lack of an intuitive interface for the user to gain the information needed to resolve such issues.
